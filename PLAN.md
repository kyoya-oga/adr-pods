# AndroidÂ AirPodsÂ ProÂ 2Â Controller â€” ImplementationÂ Plan

## Goals

* Provide a **native FOSS Android app** (MITâ€‘licensed, no ads or tracking) that controls AirPodsÂ Proâ€¯2 on devices running **AndroidÂ 6.0Â (APIÂ 23) or later**.
* Deliver the **widest possible feature set without requiring root**; enable additional functions when root is available.
* Avoid Apple trademarks and proprietary images; UI follows MaterialÂ 3 design with darkâ€‘theme support.

## FeatureÂ Scope

### ðŸ”¹Â P0Â (MVPÂ â€“Â nonâ€‘root, mustâ€‘have)

1. **Connection & Autoâ€‘Reconnect**
   â€¢ Primary pathÂ â€“ BLE **L2CAPÂ CoC** (PSMÂ `0x1001`) transporting **AppleÂ AccessoryÂ ProtocolÂ (AAP)** packets.
   â€¢ FallbackÂ â€“ BLEÂ **GATT** Battery ServiceÂ (`0x180F`) when L2CAP is unavailable.
2. **Battery Status**Â (L / R / Case + charging state).
3. **Noise Control**Â â€“ toggle **ANCÂ / TransparencyÂ / Off** via AAPÂ OpcodeÂ `0x0D`.
4. **Compose UI**Â â€“ MaterialÂ 3, singleâ€‘screen MVP with darkâ€‘theme.

### ðŸ”¹Â P1Â (ExtensionÂ â€“Â nonâ€‘root)

5. **AdaptiveÂ Audio** & **ConversationalÂ Awareness**Â (AAPÂ OpcodesÂ `0x2E` / `0x28`).
6. **Inâ€‘Ear Detection**Â â†’ automatic play / pause through `MediaSession`.
7. **Caseâ€‘Open Popâ€‘Up**Â â€“ iOSâ€‘style banner when the lid opens.
8. **WearÂ OS Tile** & homeâ€‘screen **Widget** for quick controls.

### ðŸ”¹Â P2Â (ExperimentalÂ â€“Â root recommended)

9. **Head Gestures**Â for call answer / media control.
10. **Rename AirPods & advanced settings** (write operations that need patched Bluetooth stack).
11. **Generic support**Â for other AirPods / Beats generations.

background â”€â–¶ ConnectedDeviceService (Fg) + AutoReconnectWorker (WorkManager)
```

### Jetpack Compose UI Approach

The entire user interface is implemented with **Jetpack Compose**. Core screens
such as device discovery, connection status, and noise control are written as
Composable functions using MaterialÂ 3 components. Each screen exposes a preview
to speed up iteration. Compose is also used for dark theme support and will
power future WearÂ OS tiles.

## KeyÂ TechnicalÂ Points

* **BLEÂ L2CAP**: `BluetoothDevice#createL2capChannel(0x1001)` for creditâ€‘based CoC; socket wrapped in Kotlin I/O coroutines.
* **AAP Packet Format**: `HeaderÂ 4Â B` + `LengthÂ 2Â B` (LE) + `OpcodeÂ 1Â B` + `Payload`.
* **Fallback Strategy**: if L2CAP connect fails or phone <Â APIâ€¯29, switch to `GattManager`â€‘driven path (BatteryÂ Service and any discovered private UUIDs).
* **Inâ€‘Ear Detection**: subscribe to AAP Sensor notifications â†’ bridge to `MediaSession` for play/pause.
* **Energy Optimisation**: Scan filter on AppleÂ VIDÂ `0x004C`, 10â€¯min scan interval, rely on HCI events while connected.
* **Root Addâ€‘Ons**: optional Magisk module that patches `libbluetooth_jni.so` to fix stack bugs and unlock write operations.

## RisksÂ &Â Mitigations

| Risk                                     | Mitigation                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **L2CAP unsupported on device**          | Autoâ€‘switch to GATT; publish compatibility list.                   |
| **Apple firmware updates break opcodes** | CI smokeâ€‘tests BLE packets; failâ€‘fast alerts.                      |
| **High power consumption**               | Intermittent scans; foreground service only while connected.       |
| **Google Play BG restrictions**          | Show mandatory UX prompt; declare correct `foregroundServiceType`. |

## Implementation Review

The current codebase includes skeleton implementations for BLE connectivity, the AAP packet utilities, and a basic Compose UI. Key components like `L2capManager`, `GattManager`, `PacketRouter`, and foreground/background services exist but many features remain incomplete.

### Observed Issues

- **Missing dependencies** for Kotlin Coroutines and WorkManager in the Gradle configuration.
- The UI lacks actions to start scanning or initiate connections.
- `PacketRouter` only handles a placeholder battery opcode.
- Dependency injection is not yet set up (temporary factory used in `MainActivity`).
- The Wear module is empty.

## Improvement Plan

1. **Add required libraries**
   - Include `kotlinx-coroutines-android` and `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx` in `libs.versions.toml` and reference them from `app/build.gradle.kts`.
2. **Implement device discovery UI with Compose**
   - Build the scanning screen as a Composable with buttons to start/stop scanning and a list of nearby devices.
   - Allow the user to select a device and trigger `ConnectionManager.connect` from the Composable UI.
3. **Expand packet handling**
   - Implement parsing for noise control opcodes and other essential AAP commands in `PacketRouter`.
4. **Introduce dependency injection**
   - Replace the manual ViewModel factory with a lightweight DI framework (e.g., Hilt or Koin) for easier testing and modularity.
5. **Background and auto-reconnect**
   - Flesh out `ConnectedDeviceService` and `AutoReconnectWorker` to maintain and restore connections when the app is not in the foreground.
6. **Prepare Wear module**
   - Set up a minimal Wear OS module with Compose for Wear OS to host future Tile/Widget code.
7. **Add unit tests**
   - Cover `AapParser`, `AapBuilder`, and connection logic to ensure compatibility with different Android versions.
